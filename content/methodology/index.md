### The Zamenhof platform offers four different course types:

* **General**  
  The lessons of the General courses are non-sequential and not progressive.
  They are lessons about a same subject (topic) that can be taken in different order.
  With the General courses, there are no regular evaluations or progress reports.

* **Exam Preparation**  
  The Exam Preparation courses are designed for more serious learners. The lessons of these courses are sequential and progressive.
  An exam course is split into a group of lessons punctuated by an evaluation session with a different teacher (certified evaluator).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All exam preparation courses are designed according to a recognized standardized test of language proficiency (such as TOEFL, IELTS, TOEIC, etc.)

* **Specialized**  
  The Specialized courses have the same structure as the General courses with the distinction of having a teacher who has extra qualifications for the subject. For example, the Legal English Course is taught by the teacher Jonathan P, who is a certified CELTA teacher but also has a degree in law (Magistrates Court qualification). He practiced law in excess of 10 years.

* **Evaluation**  
  The exam evaluations are live lessons in which a certified evaluator will contact you to assess your current progress.
  Before the live lesson with the evaluator, the student has to complete a set of exercises. 
  Once the evaluation is completed, the student will receive an email within 12 hours with the evaluation result.
  The student can view the results of the evaluation form the Progress Report page and download a one page pdf file or a six page report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The graph section of the progress report page will display the progress per area.
