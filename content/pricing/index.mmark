## Teacher salary

**GROUP LESSON**

* The salary is fixed and doesnâ€™t depend on the number pupils
  attending the virtual class.

* The cost of group classes can be shared with other schools from the
  Zamenhof network.

The teacher's salary depends on (1)the course type and (2)the package
renewal rate. When ever a student purchases a package of **at least 4
lessons,** the teacher will receive a higher salary per lesson according to the list below.

<details>
<summary>View example</summary>
<p>
If a student purchases a 10-lesson package with Teacher A, Teacher A will receive $6.00 per lesson.

If the same student purchases a second package of 10 lessons with Teacher A, Teacher A will receive $6.50 per lesson.

If the same student purchases a third package, but instead will have 3 lessons with Teacher A, and 7 lessons with Teacher B, the cost will be as follows:

* Teacher A will be $6.50 per lesson.
* Teacher B will be $6.00 per lesson.
